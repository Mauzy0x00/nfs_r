# Network File System - Reimagined (in Rust)
- This is a project entry for the Hackathon PennState University is hosting 
- The category this project aims at is "10th Anniversary: Timeless Tech". NFS was developed in 1984 by Sun MircoSystems and built on top of the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call. It has had 4 revisions since its inception and most recently is at version 4.2 which was released in 2016.
- The purpose of this project is to reimagine NFS with security in mind using a memory safe programming language, Rust. This will be re-build from the bottom up. Striving first for functionality with security by default, then focusing on user experience.

### I will continue to build this project when I have time. Here is a screenshot of an example connection to the network file system server:
